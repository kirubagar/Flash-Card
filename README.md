🃏 Kannada-English Flashcard App
A simple Tkinter-based flashcard application that helps you learn Kannada vocabulary by testing you on words you haven't mastered yet.

📌 Features
Displays Kannada words with English translations after 3 seconds.

✅ Mark words you know — they’ll be removed from future tests.

❌ Skip words you don’t know — they’ll appear again later.

Saves your progress in words_to_learn.csv, so you only practice words you haven’t learned.

Automatically loads your saved progress on the next run.
